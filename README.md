# APTrust Ansible Config Files

These files are used to configure and manage servers and services for the
Academic Preservation Trust.

These are very early files as we are getting use to ansible and particularly
getting use to ansible best practices and they are prone to change often.

# External Var Files
Private variables are stored in an external folder.  See the Lead Engineer for
access these external folders. It should be copied to your home directory under
the ~/.ansible directory to work approparitely.

Eventually we will be calling this via a command line argument but for now
just put it where we indicate above.
