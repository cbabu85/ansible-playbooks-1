### Welcome to the InfluxDB configuration file.

# Once every 24 hours InfluxDB will report anonymous data to m.influxdb.com
# The data includes raft id (random 8 bytes), os, arch, version, and metadata.
# We don't track ip addresses of servers reporting. This is only used
# to track the number of instances running and the versions, which
# is very helpful for us.
# Change this option to true to disable reporting.
reporting-disabled = {{ influxdb_reporting_disabled }}

# we'll try to get the hostname automatically, but if it the os returns something
# that isn't resolvable by other servers in the cluster, use this option to
# manually set the hostname
# hostname = "localhost"
hostname = "{{ influxdb_hostname }}"

### Controls the parameters for the Raft consensus group that stores metadata

### [data]
###
### Controls where the actual shard data for InfluxDB lives and how it is
### flushed from the WAL. "dir" may need to be changed to a suitable place
### for your system, but the WAL settings are an advanced configuration. The
### defaults should work for most systems.

###
### Controls non-Raft cluster behavior, which generally includes how data is
### shared across shards.

###
### Controls the system self-monitoring, statistics and diagnostics.
###
### The internal database for monitoring data is created automatically if
### if it does not already exist. The target retention within this database
### is called 'monitor' and is also created with a retention period of 7 days
### and a replication factor of 1, if it does not exist. In all cases the
### this retention policy is configured as the default for the database.
