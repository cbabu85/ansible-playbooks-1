# Deploys Pharos on production
#
# Pre-requisites:
# This role requires a server instance that has had the allservers.docker.yml
# playbook applied. The play includes user account setup, ssh and installation
# of Docker deamon as well as Traefik setup for TLS and reverse proxy.
#
##  - Base dir: for docker apps is /srv/docker/<appname>
#     The base directory is used to clone the git repository into. Is used for
#     starting Docker app per docker-compose. Also configuration in the .env
#     file is updated upon deployment.
#   - Data dir: /data/pharos
#     The data directory is used for storing persistent data like logs between
#     redeploys.
